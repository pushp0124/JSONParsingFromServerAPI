# JSONParsingFromServerAPI #

## Project Description ##
The project parses the JSON data fetched from the test website https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com using third party library SWIFTYJSON. 

The network request is made through Alamofire, another very popular third party library. 

The project is made following the design pattern of Model, View, Controller including the usage of Closures.
